There are some old files here, but right now I'm using:
* Open bookmarklet.html with Firefox, and follow instructions there; save result to ./threadTopics.json
* (from the repo root:) npm install ; cd import ; (create ./imapCredentials.js first, from ./imapCredentials.js.sample in this directory)
* mkdir posts ; cd posts ; node ../searcher.js
* cd .. ; node threadMatcher.js
* cd .. ; sh build.sh
