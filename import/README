There are some old files here, but right now I'm using bookmarklet.html to determine thread topics, and searcher.js (create imapCredentials.js first, from imapCredentials.js.sample in this directory, then run with node) to import post bodies from IMAP.
I save the thread topics to ./threadTopics.json, and the posts to ./posts/, and then run threadMatcher.js to create ../index/threads.json
