	"description": "Copyright law gives you control over how your content (texts, photos, videos, etc.) can be used, by whom they can be distributed, modified, etc. Sometimes, online services need your permission to perform certain tasks with your content. That's why they ask you to grant them a copyright license. But sometimes, the copyright license is so broad, that your content can be exploited by others without asking you."
