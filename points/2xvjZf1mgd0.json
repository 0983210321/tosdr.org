    "tldr": "The license that you grant to Google on content you upload to their services will continue even if you stop using the services. While this makes sense for some services (e.g. Google Maps) this applies by default to all Google services. Otherwise you need to check each service for ways to remove content and for specific clauses that restrict the license in time."
