	"tldr": "Twitter can change the terms at any time when they see fit. They give notification, in their sole disretion, via an @Twitter update or via email. In September 2009, Twitter considerably changed the terms for the copyright license (from claiming no copyright over your content and encouraging public domain) to ask for a very broad copyright license on your content. There was very little involvement of users on that critical change."
