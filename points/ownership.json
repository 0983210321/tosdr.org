	description: "The content and the data you generate on services online is usually subject to copyright law. It means that it is <strong>your content, your data</strong> and copyright law gives you control over how they can be used, by whom they can be distributed, modified, etc. Sometimes, online services need your permission to perform certain tasks with your data. That's why they ask you to grant them a copyright license. But sometimes, the copyright license is so broad, that the service is using you at the expense of your rights."
	example: {
		good: "You license us to use your data only for the purpose of operating this service.",
		mediocre: "We get a license beyond the requirements to operate the service, so your data may be used for purposes you do not intend. We will still attribute ownership to you.",
		alert: "We become the owners of your data."
