<h2>This website will contain the results of today's workshop, to be held by the dead tree, visible from the CCC camp tickets office (and near "La Quadrature.net" Village)</h2>
This will be a crowd-reading hub for those texts we never read when we sign up on a website. The idea is to follow a process similar to Universal Subtitles:
<ul>
<li>ADD: Add a website, with the text of its current Terms-of-Service, and parts of it that are forked out into a separate document, as is often done with the Privacy Policy.
<li>READ: Use the tag list to indicate what each phrase is about.
<li>ORGANIZE: If there is no tag that describes well what that sentence says, then create a new tag. Organize the tags into groups, merging duplicates.
<li>VOTE: Vote "good", "neutral" or "evil", comparing tags against others in the same category, as well as rating categories as a whole.
<li>RATE: The summing the weighted tags give us a number which we scale from 0 stars (evil) to 5 stars (good). 
<li>USE: Once we have some ratings published, we'll put them into a Firefox extension, so that you can set a threshold and be protected against evil websites.
<li>ADJUST: Power users can adapt category weights to their personal tastes.
</ul>
