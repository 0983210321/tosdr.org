    "tldr": "e621 contains many drawn, painted, and 3D-modeled artwork of fictional anthropomorphic characters, much of which is explicit. It is not meant to be accessed by underage users. Anyone who is known or suspected to be underage will have their accounts permanently blocked, although the blocked user can send an email to the site's management to prove they are of age to visit the site if this happens. Through this method, if the administration determines that the user blocked for being underage is presently of age, then they will unblock that user's account.\r\n\r\nThis policy applies to both e621 and its \"work-safe\" database mirror e926, which only displays non-explicit images. (i.e. Only images that are rated \"Safe\" by the site's three-tiered content rating system, consisting of \"Safe\", \"Questionable\", and \"Explicit\".)",
